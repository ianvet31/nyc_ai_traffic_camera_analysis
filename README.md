# NYC AI Traffic Camera Analysis
Using Object Recognition Models to extract features about traffic patterns from NYC's free traffic camera API.


## Introduction
Powerful AI image recognition models, combined with datasets from traffic cameras, provide a robust framework for analyzing urban traffic patterns. By leveraging these advanced technologies, it becomes possible to gain insights into vehicle and pedestrian behavior, assess traffic density, and track objects across the city. This project explores how traffic camera data can be processed and analyzed using AI to enhance understanding of urban mobility and inform traffic management strategies.

## Data Source
For this analysis, the publicly available NYC traffic camera API serves as the data source. This API offers access to a wealth of real-time images from approximately 1,000 traffic cameras scattered throughout the city. A process has been established to scrape data from around 1,000 cameras in about 2 minutes, ensuring timely access to critical information. Each camera provides high-resolution images that allow for tracking traffic conditions across different locations in the city.

## Processing all traffic Cameras
Now that we have identified useful features we can extract from individual traffic cameras, we want to leverage these cameras to extract broader analytics. We can continuously scrape all of the NYC traffic cameras that are available to understand the density, traffic patterns and even track objects across the city. This is parallelized to be able to scrape ~1k traffic cameras in ~2min.

## Traffic Analysis
We can now plot our data on a heatmap to analyze the traffic patterns across the city. This function renders the image recognition data into an interactive map with images. Once a handle on the features extracted from individual cameras is established, the analysis is scaled up. Continuous scraping of images from the entire network of NYC traffic cameras enables broader analytics on traffic density and patterns. With a parallelized scraping approach, tracking the movement of objects across the city in real time becomes possible.

This large-scale data collection helps identify traffic trends, peak congestion times, and the distribution of vehicles and pedestrians throughout the city. Ultimately, this information can inform better traffic management strategies and infrastructure planning.

## Results
The analysis of traffic camera data has led to the creation of detailed heatmaps that visualize traffic density across various locations in New York City. These heatmaps are generated by aggregating data from multiple traffic cameras and using AI algorithms to identify and quantify vehicle and pedestrian counts.

### Heatmap Correlation with Average Traffic
The generated heatmaps effectively align with known patterns of average traffic in NYC. By comparing the heatmap outputs with historical traffic data, it is evident that areas identified as high-density zones correlate with regions typically known for congestion, such as major intersections and commercial districts.

This alignment validates the accuracy of the analysis and highlights the model's ability to reflect real-world traffic conditions. The heatmaps serve as a visual representation of traffic flow, enabling stakeholders to quickly grasp areas of high activity and congestion.

### Determining Density and Traffic Levels
Through the use of advanced image recognition techniques and data aggregation, it is possible to accurately determine traffic density and levels across the city. The analysis reveals patterns such as peak traffic hours, frequent congestion points, and variations in pedestrian activity throughout the day.

This capability allows for a dynamic understanding of traffic patterns, making it easier to assess the impact of events or changes in urban infrastructure. Moreover, the insights gained can assist city planners and traffic managers in developing strategies to alleviate congestion and enhance urban mobility.

By integrating these findings into a real-time monitoring system, NYC can leverage AI-driven analytics to make data-informed decisions that improve traffic management and contribute to the overall efficiency of the transportation network.

## Conclusions
Analyzing NYC traffic cameras with the COCO Image Recognition model allows for the extraction of valuable insights that enhance the understanding of urban traffic dynamics. The ability to process around 1,000 cameras in about 2 minutes provides a significant edge in accessing real-time analytics.

These findings not only contribute to city planning and traffic management but also open the door to developing interactive real-time dashboards. Such dashboards could visualize traffic patterns, highlight congestion hotspots, and provide predictive insights for better decision-making. Furthermore, the object tracking capabilities developed through this analysis could be extended to monitor the movement of vehicles and pedestrians across the city. This level of granularity could enhance safety measures and inform urban planning efforts, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient navigation throughout NYC.
